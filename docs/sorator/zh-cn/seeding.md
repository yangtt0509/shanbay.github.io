# Seeding

## Introduction

Orator includes a simple method of seeding your database with test data using seed classes.
Seed classes may have any name you wish, but probably should follow some sensible convention,
such as ``UsersTableSeeder``, etc.
By default, a ``DatabaseSeeder`` class is defined for you the first time you create a seed class.
From this class, you can use the ``call`` method to run other seed classes,
allowing you to control the seeding order.

## Writing Seeders

To generate a seeder, you may issue the ``make:seed`` command.
All seeders generated by the command will be placed in a ``seeds`` directory
relative to where the command has been executed:

```text
orator make:seed user_table_seeder
```

>**Note**  
>
>If you want the seed classes to be stored in another directory, use the ``-p/--path`` option

A seeder class only contains one method by default: ``run``.
This method is called when the ``db:seed`` command is executed.
Within the ``run`` method, you can insert data into your database however you wish.
You can use the `QueryBuilder` to manually insert data or you can use `ModelFactories`.

As an example, let's modify the ``UsersTableSeeder`` class you just created.
Let's add a database insert statement to the ``run`` method:

```python
from orator.seeds import Seeder


class UsersTableSeeder(Seeder):

    def run(self):
        """
        Run the database seeds.
        """

        # Here you could just use random string generators
        # rather than hardcoded values
        self.db.table('users').insert({
            'name': 'john',
            'email': 'john@doe.com'
        })
```

### Using Model Factories

Of course, manually specifying the attributes for each model seed is cumbersome.
Instead, you can use `ModelFactories` to conveniently generate large amounts of database records.
First, review the `model factory documentation <ModelFactories>` to learn how to define your factories.
You can use an external factory or use the seeder class ``factory`` attribute.

For example, let's create 50 users and attach a relationship to each user:

```python
from orator.seeds import Seeder
from orator.orm import Factory


factory = Factory()


@factory.define(User)
def users_factory(faker):
    return {
        'name': faker.name(),
        'email': faker.email()
    }


@factory.define(Post)
def posts_factory(faker):
    return {
        'title': faker.name(),
        'content': faker.text()
    }


class UsersTableSeeder(Seeder):

    factory = factory  # This is only needed when using an external factory

    def run(self):
        """
        Run the database seeds.
        """
        self.factory(User, 50).create().each(
            lambda u: u.posts().save(self.factory(Post).make())
        )
```

Or using directly the ``factory`` attribute without an external factory:

```python
class UsersTableSeeder(Seeder):

    def run(self):
        """
        Run the database seeds.
        """
        self.factory.register(User, self.users_factory)
        self.factory.register(Post, self.posts_factory)

        self.factory(User, 50).create().each(
            lambda u: u.posts().save(self.factory(Post).make())
        )

    def users_factory(self, faker):
        return {
            'name': faker.name(),
            'email': faker.email()
        }

    def posts_factory(self, faker):
        return {
            'title': faker.name(),
            'content': faker.text()
        }
```

### Calling Additional Seeders

Within the ``DatabaseSeeder`` class, you can use the ``call`` method to execute additional seed classes.
Using the ``call`` method allows you to break up your database seeding into multiple files
so that no single seeder class becomes overwhelmingly large.
Simply pass the seeder class you wish to run:

```python
def run(self):
    """
    Run the database seeds.
    """
    self.call(UsersTableSeeder)
    self.call(PostsTableSeeder)
    self.call(CommentsTableSeeder)
```

## Running Seeders

Once you have written your seeder classes, you may use the ``db:seed`` command to seed your database.
By default, the ``db:seed`` command runs the ``database_seeder`` file, which can be used to call other seed classes.
However, you can use the ``--seeder`` option to specify a specific seeder class to run individually:

```python
orator db:seed
orator db:seed --seeder users_table_seeder
```

You can also seed your database using the ``migrate:refresh`` command,
which will also rollback and re-run all of your migrations.
This command is useful for completely re-building your database:

```python
orator migrate:refresh --seed
```
