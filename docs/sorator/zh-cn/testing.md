# Testing

## Model Factories

When testing, it is common to need to insert a few records into your database before executing your test.
Instead of manually specifying the value of each column when you create this test data,
Orator allows you to define a default set of attributes for each of your models using "factories":

```python
from orator.orm import Factory

factory = Factory()

@factory.define(User)
def users_factory(faker):
    return {
        'name': faker.name(),
        'email': faker.email()
    }
```

Within the function (here ``users_factory``), which serves as the factory definition,
you can return the default test values of all attributes on the model.
The function will receive an instance of the [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) library,
which allows you to conveniently generate various kinds of random data for testing.

### Multiple Factory Types

Sometimes you may wish to have multiple factories for the same model class.
For example, perhaps you would like to have a factory for "Administrator" users in addition to normal users.
You can define these factories using the ``define_as`` method:

```python
@factory.define_as(User, 'admin')
def admins_factory(faker):
    return {
        'name': faker.name(),
        'email': faker.email(),
        'admin': True
    }
```

Instead of duplicating all of the attributes from your base user factory,
you can use the ``raw`` method to retrieve the base attributes.
Once you have the attributes, simply supplement them with any additional values you require:

```python
@factory.define_as(User, 'admin')
def admins_factory(faker):
    user = factory.raw(User)

    user.update({
        'admin': True
    })

    return user
```

### Using Factories In Tests

Once you have defined your factories, you can use them in your tests or database seed files
to generate model instances calling the ``Factory`` instance.
So, let's take a look at a few examples of creating models.
First, we'll use the ``make`` method, which creates models but does not save them to the database:

```python
def test_database():
    user = factory(User).make()

    # Use model in tests
```

If you would like to override some of the default values of your models,
you can pass keyword arguments to the ``make`` method.
Only the specified values will be replaced while the rest of the values remain
set to their default values as specified by the factory:

```python
def test_database():
    user = factory(User).make(name='John')
```

You can also create a ``Collection`` of many models or create models of a given type:

```python
# Create 3 User instances
users = factory(User, 3).make()

# Create a User "admin" instance
admin = factory(User, 'admin').make()

# Create three User "admin" instances
admins = factory(User, 'admin', 3).make()
```

### Persisting Factory Models

The ``create`` method not only creates the model instances,
but also saves them to the database using models' ``save`` method:

```python
def test_database():
    user = factory(User).create()

    # Use model in tests
```

Again, you can override attributes on the model by passing an array to the ``create`` method:
```python
def test_database():
    user = factory(User).create(name='John')
```

### Adding Relations To Models

You may even persist multiple models to the database.
In this example, we'll even attach a relation to the created models.
When using the ``create`` method to create multiple models, a ``Collection`` instance is returned,
allowing you to use any of the convenient functions provided by the collection, such as ``each``:

```python
users = factory(User, 3).create()
users.each(lambda u: u.save(factory(Post).make()))
```
