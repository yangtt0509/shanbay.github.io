# Pagination

## Paginate database records

There are several ways to paginate items. The simplest is by using the ``paginate`` method
on the `QueryBuilder` or an `ORM` query.
The ``paginate`` method provided by Orator automatically takes care of setting
the proper limit and offset based on the current page.
By default, the current page needs to be specified.
However, as we'll see it later, you can create a custom current page resolver.

### Paginating Query Builder results

First, let's take a look at calling the ``paginate`` method on a query generated by the query builder:

```python
users = db.table('users').paginate(15, 2)
```

In this example, the first argument passed to paginate is the number of items we would like displayed "per page"
and the second is the current page we want to display. So, in this case, we want to retrieve ``15`` items on page ``2``.

>**Warning**  
>
>Currently, pagination operations that use a ``group_by`` statement cannot be executed efficiently by Orator.
    If you need to use a ``group_by`` with a paginated result set, it is recommended that you query the database
    and create a paginator manually.
    
### Paginating models
You can also paginate `ORM` queries. In this example, we will paginate the ``User`` model with ``15`` items per page
for the second page. As you can see, the syntax is nearly identical to paginating query builder results:

```python
all_users = User.paginate(15, 2)
```

Of course, you can call paginate after setting other constraints on the query:

```python
some_users = User.where('votes', '>', 100).paginate(15, 2)
```

#### Simple pagination

If you only need "Next" and "Previous" pages in your pagination,
you have the option of using the ``simple_paginate`` method to perform a more efficient query.

```python
some_users = User.where('votes', '>', 100).simple_paginate(15, 2)
```

### Creating a Paginator manually

Sometimes you may wish to create a pagination instance manually, passing it a list of items.
You can do so by creating either a ``Paginator`` or a ``LengthAwarePaginator`` instance, depending on your needs.

The ``Paginator`` class does not need to know the total number of items in the result set;
however, because of this, the class does not have methods to retrieve the index of the last page.
The ``LengthAwarePaginator`` accepts almost the same arguments as the ``Paginator``,
except that it does require a count of the total number of items in the result set.

In other words, the ``Paginator`` corresponds to the ``simple_paginate`` method on the query builder
and the ORM, while the ``LengthAwarePaginator`` corresponds to the ``paginate`` method.

## Displaying Results

When you call the ``paginate`` or ``simple_paginate`` methods on a query builder or ORM query,
you will receive a paginator instance. When calling the ``paginate`` method,
you will receive an instance of ``LengthAwarePaginator``. When calling the ``simple_paginate`` method,
you will receive an instance of ``Paginator``. These objects provide several methods and attributes
that describe the result set. In addition to these helpers methods, the paginator instances are iterators
and may be looped as a list.

```python
for user in some_users:
    print(user.name)
```

### Additional attributes and helper methods

You may also access additional pagination information via the following methods and attributes
on paginator instances:

| Method or attribute           | Description                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `results.count()`             | Returns the number of results on the current page                          |
| `results.current_page`        | The current page of the paginator                                          |
| `results.has_more_pages()`    | Returns ``True`` if there is more pages else ``False``                     |
| `results.last_page`           | The number of the last page (Not available when using ``simple_paginate``) |
| `results.next_page`           | The number of the next page if it exists else ``None``                     |
| `results.per_page`            | The number of results per page                                             |
| `results.previous_page`       | The number of the previous page if it exists else ``None``                 |
| `results.total`               | The total number of results (Not available when using ``simple_paginate``  |

## Converting Results To JSON

The Orator paginator result classes expose the ``to_json`` method,
so it's very easy to convert your pagination results to JSON.

Be default, it will return the JSON formatted underlying ``Collection``:

```python
some_users = User.where('votes', '>', 100).paginate(15, 2)

print(some_users.to_json())
```

## Setting a custom current page resolver

Sometimes, you may want to compute the current page based on external parameters.
For that purpose, you can set a custom current page resolver on the ``Paginator`` class.
In this example, the current page will be determined by a ``?page`` query string parameter:

```python
from orator import Paginator
from flask import request


def current_page_resolver():
    return int(request.args.get('page', 1))

Paginator.current_page_resolver(current_page_resolver)
```

So from now on, It is no longer necessary to specify the current page:

```python
some_users = User.where('votes', '>', 100).paginate(15)
```
